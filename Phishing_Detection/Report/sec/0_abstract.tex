Phishing has been recognized as the easiest and
most widespread cyber-security threat as it targets the
weakest link in the security chain, the user. This paper is
dedicated to the identification of phishing websites using machine learning techniques (MLTs) as a robust mechanism.
The dataset utilized for this research is sourced from ’Mendeley
data,’ comprising 11,430 URLs with 87 extracted features. The
dataset is balanced, it contains exactly 50\% phishing and 50\%
legitimate URLs. Our primary objective is to conduct a comparative analysis of various machine learning models, with the aim of identifying the optimal model through a systematic optimization process.
